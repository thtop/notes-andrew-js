# Setting up Your Computer

## Dowload and Install

1.  VS Code -> Write code
2.  NodeJS -> Run Code
3.  cmder (Windows only) -> Run command to execute the code we write (I use bash on VS code)

## The Terminal

- `node -v`
- `clear`
- `pwd`
- `cd Desktop` (top on target directory)
- `cd ..`
- `ls`
- `node fileName.js` (Run file .js)
